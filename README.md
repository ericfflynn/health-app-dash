# [Eric Flynn's Personal Fitness Dashboard](https://eric-flynn-health-app.herokuapp.com/)
## Summary
The personal fitness dashboard tracks fitness progess through the use of KPI's and interactive visuals. 
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create my first fully-interactive, web hosted application. I have a passion for fitness, so it only seemed fitting to make my first web app fitness related. 
## Data Source
All data comes from an Apple Watch. [Health Auto Export](https://www.healthexportapp.com/) is used to preprocess the data into JSON format prior to being loaded into the app. 
### *Note: Loading will take 10-20 seconds sometimes
